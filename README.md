I just made a very pretty plugin for daily notes in neovim. I have it setup on the keyboard shortcuts of of super+d for window manager and <C-d> inside neovim, and even as a simple button press `d` when i im in nvims homepage.

This code could be used for more general purposes. Lets say i am editing a markdown file, i could enable it and the width of the file would now be 80 char, and on the left and right there would a nice buffer. I would also change the color of the margins, or mage change the size of the file in the middle. There are many possibilities. Basically i recreated the plugin called [no-neck-pain](https://github.com/shortcuts/no-neck-pain.nvim).
